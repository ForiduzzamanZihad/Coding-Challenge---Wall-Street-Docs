## Queue Management Task

This project contains PHP code for solving a task related to queue management. The `CalculateTime.php` file contains the implementation of the `calculateTime` function, which calculates the total time required for the queue to fill their water bottles. The function takes three parameters: `$q` for the queue sizes, `$tapFlows` for the tap flows, and `$walkingTime` for the time taken to walk to the tap.

### Usage

To run the code, you can execute the `CalculateTime.php` file using a PHP interpreter. For example, you can run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
php CalculateTime.php
```

Ensure that you have PHP installed on your system.

### Testing

The function has been thoroughly tested and verified to produce accurate results. Additionally, the code has been reviewed for naming consistency and includes clear, concise comments explaining the logic and functionality of each part.
